# DataProcessing

Used late day wild-card for the line graph asignment
Link to website: https://corne12345.github.io/DataProcessing-/

Due to illness, I was not able to finish the scatter plot assignment completely. All the parts up to and including coloring the 
points have been completed. This means there is no legend and there is no possibility to update the graph. 
There have also been no attemps made to clean the code or to make a visually appealing website.
I will finish the project this weekend to fully understand all the aspects of this assignment and to prepare myself as best as possible
for the final project.
