Used late day wild-card for the line graph asignment
Link to website: https://corne12345.github.io/DataProcessing-/

5-12-2018: The website doesn't seem to be updating when the html files have changed. Therefore, an older html file is loaded (and gives an error), while the most recent version should be working. I try to update this tomorrow.
